# Movie-recomm-system-cosine-similarity-
 The aim of this project is to build a movie recommendation system based on cosine similarity. In this project, we explore two techniques: traditional machine learning (ML) and modern deep learning (DL) approaches. Both methods rely on the cosine similarity metric to find similarities between movies based on their features.
