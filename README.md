Movie Recommendation System Based on Cosine Similarity
Overview
This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using two approaches: traditional machine learning and modern deep learning. Both techniques leverage cosine similarity to identify movies that are most similar to a given query movie based on their features.

The system compares the effectiveness of content-based filtering techniques:
1) Machine Learning (vectorized features like tags and descriptions).
2) Deep Learning (contextual embeddings generated by Sentence-BERT).
Features
1) Recommends movies based on similarity to a query movie.
2) Supports both:
 a) Machine Learning (using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF).
 b) Deep Learning (using Sentence-BERT embeddings).
3) Comparative analysis of recommendations provided by the two approaches.
4) Handles large movie datasets effectively.]

Dataset
The system uses the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset:
1) tmdb_5000_movies.csv: Contains movie metadata such as titles, overviews, and genres.
2) tmdb_5000_credits.csv: Includes cast and crew information for each movie.

Technologies Used
Programming Language
Python

Libraries
1) Machine Learning
 a) Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
 b) NumPy: For numerical operations.
 c) Scikit-learn: For vectorization (CountVectorizer, TF-IDF) and cosine similarity computation.
2) Deep Learning
 a) Sentence-Transformers: For generating contextual embeddings using pre-trained Sentence-BERT models.
 b) Scikit-learn: For cosine similarity computation.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing
1) Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and removed irrelevant data.
2) Feature Engineering: Combined relevant textual features such as tags and overviews to create a unified content representation for each movie.
3) Vectorization:
 a) Machine Learning: Used CountVectorizer or TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text into numerical vectors.
 b) Deep Learning: Generated embeddings with Sentence-BERT.

Recommendation Process
1) Compute cosine similarity between a query movie and all other movies in the dataset.
2) Rank movies based on similarity scores.
3) Return the top-N recommendations.
   
Results
1) Machine Learning Approach: Provides decent recommendations but struggles to capture deeper semantic relationships.
2) Deep Learning Approach: Leverages contextual embeddings to deliver more accurate and meaningful recommendations, even for nuanced queries.

Setup Instructions
1) Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
2) Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3) Place the dataset files (tmdb_5000_movies.csv and tmdb_5000_credits.csv) in the project directory.
4) Run the script:
python main.py

Usage
1) Input a movie title (e.g., "Kung Fu Panda 2").
2) Select the recommendation method:
 a) Machine Learning (CountVectorizer or TF-IDF).
 b) Deep Learning (Sentence-BERT embeddings).
3) View the recommended movies ranked by similarity.

Future Improvements
1) Expand dataset to include user ratings and implement collaborative filtering.
2) Incorporate hybrid recommendation techniques.
3) Optimize deep learning models for larger datasets.
4) Improve the UI/UX for better user interaction.
